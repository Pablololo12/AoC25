Downloader exports get-day and get-example.

get-day automatically downloads the input if it doesn't exists. You will need
your cookie in .aoccookie.txt

get-example requires you to paste the example under inputs as example{day}_{part}

To run either use geiser or call `guile --auto-compile -L . day01.scm`
